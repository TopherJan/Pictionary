##### A project for UPVTC CMSC 140 course

## What is Pictionary?

Pictionary is a trademarked word that combines the concept of "pictures" with "dictionary." The aim of the game is to guess words from pictures.

## INSTRUCTIONS:

When its your turn to draw, a random word will be shown and you will have to visualize that word in 60 seconds, alternatively when somebody else is drawing you have to type your guess into the chat to gain points, be quick, the earlier you guess a word the more points you get!
